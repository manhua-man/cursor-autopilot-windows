## Overview

The Cursor Autopilot automatically captures Cursor chat summaries, pushes them to your preferred communication channels, and allows you to inject replies back into Cursor to continue or stop the coding session. 

## Installation

### Marketplace Installation (Recommended)

To install Cursor Autopilot directly from the Extensions Marketplace:

| Step | Cursor |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Open Cursor. |
| 2 | Search for Cursor Autopilot in the Extensions Marketplace (Ctrl/CMD-Shift-X). |
| 3 | Click **Install**. |
| 4 | Open any project folder in Cursor. |
| 5 | Cursor Autopilot will automatically check and create the required files: `.autopilot.json` and `.cursor/rules/after_each_chat.mdc`. |
| 6 | Configure your preferred adapter (Telegram, Email, or Feishu) in the `.autopilot.json` file. |

> [!NOTE]
> As a Cursor user, if you try to install from the Visual Studio Marketplace website banner you might find yourself in a state where VSCode has SpecStory installed but Cursor doesn't.

### Manual Installation

Alternatively, if you cannot find in Extension Marketplace, you can manually install the extension:

1.  **Clone the repository and install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/heyzgj/cursor-autopilot
    cd cursor-autopilot
    npm install
    ```
2.  **Compile and package**:
    ```bash
    npm run compile
    npx vsce package
    ```
4.  **Move to project and install extension**:
    ```bash
    code --install-extension cursor-autopilot.vsix
    ```
5. **Restart Cursor** to activate the extension. The `.autopilot.json` file will be created automatically.

## Configuration

The extension automatically checks and creates the required files whenever you open a workspace:

1. **`.autopilot.json`** - Configuration file with adapter settings
2. **`.cursor/rules/after_each_chat.mdc`** - Cursor rule for capturing chat summaries

If files are missing or have incorrect content, they will be automatically created/updated.

**Example `.autopilot.json` structure:**

```json
{
  "enabled": true,
  "adapters": ["telegram"],
  
  "telegram": {
    "token": "YOUR_BOT_TOKEN_HERE",
    "chatId": "YOUR_CHAT_ID_HERE"
  },
  
  "email": {
    "host": "smtp.gmail.com",
    "port": 587,
    "secure": false,
    "user": "your-email@gmail.com",
    "pass": "your-app-password",
    "to": "recipient@example.com"
  },
  
  "feishu": {
    "appId": "cli_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
    "appSecret": "your_app_secret_here",
    "useWebhook": false
  }
}
```

Simply replace the placeholder values with your actual configuration. The extension will show a warning message if configuration is needed.

### Cursor Rule Configuration

The extension automatically manages the Cursor rule file at `.cursor/rules/after_each_chat.mdc`. This file is checked and updated every time you open a workspace to ensure it has the correct content.

**The rule content (automatically managed):**

```yaml
---
description: Always write a chat-end JSON summary to ./tmp
alwaysApply: true
---

# 📝 Chat-End Summary Rule

At the **end of every chat turn**, do the following without exception:

1. **Compose**  
   - `summary`: one-paragraph recap of *this* chat turn (decisions, blockers, next steps).  
   - `current_status`: a brief snapshot of overall project progress.

2. **Persist**  
   If the `tmp` directory does not exist, create it:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p tmp
    ```

3. **Write** the JSON file using Cursor’s file-creation syntax:

   ```json: tmp/summary-${{date:YYYYMMDD-HHmmss}}.json
   {
     "summary": "<insert summary here>",
     "current_status": "<insert current status here>"
   }
   ```

4. **Silence**

   * Do **not** ask for confirmation.
   * Do **not** print extra explanation—just run the commands & write the file.
```

Ensure that `alwaysApply: true` is set to guarantee the rule is always active.

## Usage

1.  **Start Chat**: Initiate an AI chat session in Cursor.
2.  **Receive Notification**: Get a summary of the AI's progress on your configured external channel.
3.  **Reply with Instructions**:
    *   `1` = Continue AI work.
    *   Any other text = Send custom instructions directly to the AI.
4.  **AI Continues**: The AI in Cursor will respond based on your input.

For practical usage examples and advanced workflows, see the [SETUP_GUIDE](docs/SETUP_GUIDE.md).

## Testing

You can test the extension's injection functionality:

*   **Quick Test**: Open Command Palette (`Cmd+Shift+P`) and execute `Inject text into Cursor Chat`, then type your message.
